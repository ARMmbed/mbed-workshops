# Getting started with the ARM mbed ecosystem


The purpose of this workshop is to help you get started with the ARM mbed ecosystem and tools. The entry point for the tools is [http://developer.mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org/). There you will find mbed enabled boards, component libraries, a web-hosted IDE and all relevant documentation for the ARM mbed ecosystem. The mbed tools are designed to work on all operating systems (Linux, Mac and Windows). The tools are free and the software is available under the commercially friendly Apache 2.0 license.

In this document we are going to go over the various tools and services that make up the ARM mbed ecosystem, as well as some key code examples that demonstrate how to get started with these tools.
