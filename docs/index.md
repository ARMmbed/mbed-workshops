# mbed Workshops

Welcome to the mbed workshops project. 

This is a collection of resources for our embedded development workshops: videos, presentations, example applications and explanations. 

We recommend reviewing the workshops in order. Currently available:

1. [Workshop 1](workshop1-intro-to-mbed-ecosystem/intro.md): an introduction to the mbed ecosystem and a few sample applications.
